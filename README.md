Pet Health Tracker

DevOps: Jenna Steele, Dan Fairchild, Kevin Tousey, Jaxxon Crowe

The Pet Health Tracker application was developed in response to a need for a user to keep track of their pets and all of their veterinarian & medical information.  

Features:
1) Add Owner name
2) Add an account to the owner for each pet
3) Setup the medical record information with medical clinic, primary vet, address and phone number
4) Add medical treatments such as vaccinations, surgeries, medications, allergies for each pet.
5) Get a list of each medical treat on each petâ€™s account


Future features that we would include are:
1) Add a method to list the weights for each pet.  We are waiting for this function to be added to include the function which is ready that adds the weights.
2) Add user login feature so that this application can be an online application to be used simultaneously by more than one user.  Currently, each user will be using their own version locally on their computer.
3) Add Ability to add a photo for each pet.  Currently, we have images of random dogs populating the image field as a placeholder.  
4) Add ability to add appointments to your calendar with push notification reminders.
5) Add ability to search for local dog parks.
6) Add ability to add task to do list i.e. giving your pet meds at certain times or applying flea/tick medications monthly.
7) Add ability to create monthly summaries of data entered.
8) Add a diet tracking feature to help find ingredient lists for dog foods for dogs with allergies using barcode api system if and when that information becomes available to the public.
9) Add ability to keep track of how your dog responds to each food for those dogs with allergies.
