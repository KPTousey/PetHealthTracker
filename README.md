Pet Health Tracker

DevOps: Jenna Steele, Dan Fairchild, Kevin Tousey, Jaxxon Crowe

The Pet Health Tracker application was developed in response to a need for a user to keep track of their pets and all of their veterinarian & medical information.  The application also tracks weights for users who would like to monitor their pet’s weight over time.

Features:
Add Owner name
Add an account to the owner for each pet
Setup the medical record information with medical clinic, primary vet, address and phone number
Add medical treatments such as vaccinations, surgeries, medications, allergies for each pet.
Get a list of each medical treat on each pet’s account


Future features that we would include are:
a method to list the weights for each pet.  We are waiting for this function to be added to include the function which is ready that adds the weights.
User login feature so that this application can be an online application to be used simultaneously by more than one user.  Currently, each user will be using their own version locally on their computer.
